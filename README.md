---------------------------

Run ETL/cleaning code first

Clean -> cleaning 2 -> drop_na


Then run analytics code. The 6 analytics code files can be run in any order you wish.


---------------------------

*To run code:*

spark-shell --deploy-mode client -i  FILENAME.scala

*Results will be directly printed out to the console when you run the code.*
